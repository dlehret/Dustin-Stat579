## In the past month, I have been preparing soil samples for particle size analysis, lifting weights, and helping my wife with recovery following her surgery.
## I am used to working with soil and spatial data using GIS
## I use a lot of raster analysis with my data. I regularly use the RStudio tool Cubist to conduct machine learning algorithms to analyze large datasets. Lastly, I use the snow package in RStudio to help in parallel processesing functions.
